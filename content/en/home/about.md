##### Hideyuki is a proactive and fast-learning site reliability engineer, eager to help develop and nurture dependable and scalable infrastructure for organizations. <br>
<br>
Starting his professional career in FDM Group as a DevOps consultant, his initial training taught him essential tools for the DevOps arsenal like Git, Docker, Selenium and Jenkins. <br>

Equipped with this knowledge, he was lucky to join DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) as a junior SRE. There, he contributed to a yearly 30,000 man-hour (equivalent to 15 headcounts) toil reduction on his first year, working on automation initiatives for the Institution Banking and Indonesia divisions. On his second year, he was enlisted as a core member to develop and deploy an in-house product DARE (*DBS Auto-Remediation Engine*) which automatically detects and recovers unhealthy services across the bank. <br>

One particular book that inspired his desire for implementing automation was *The Phoenix Project*, where Bill Palmer endures against all odds to streamline IT processes and ressurect his company from the ashes. We should seek improvement in all that we do; as Gene puts simply *"Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work"*.<br>

On his free time, Hideyuki enjoys all kinds of outdoor sports & indoor games with friends. Sports that *ideally* keep him active are basketball, badminton and hiking. As for games, *Codenames*, *Betrayal at House on the Hill* and poker rank at the top of his list. <br><br>
