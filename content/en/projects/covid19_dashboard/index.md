#### Motivation

Covid-19 was(is) an unprecedented pandemic that [stole the jobs of 114 million people](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/covid-employment-global-job-loss/) in 2020 and the [lives of another 2.8 million](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/) as of 1st April 2021.


Relying on data gathered by Our World In Data ([OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/)), this project hopes to extract and visualize the global status of covid-19 in order to better understand its progression.
The [OWID Database](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) is updated everyday at roughly 08:30 UTC.

From the visualization above, we can see that Gibraltar and Israel leads the world in fully vaccinated residents, at 84.6% and 55.5% of their population respectively.

Other visualizations track the no. of cases and deaths in each country due to Covid-19, as well as the evolution of covid-19 severity.
